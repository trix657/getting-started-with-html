<h1>Important Concepts</h1>

  <b>How the Web Works.</b><br>
  <p>The web works by having a browser on a personal
  computer send a HTTP request for a webpage to a server. The server then finds the correct HTML(<em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>) document and returns that to the web browser which 
  translates the code into what you see.</p>
  <b>Tags and Elements</b>
  <p>HTML documents are made up of <a href="https:/www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/1-3508959201/m-4872344"><em>Tags and Elements</em></a>. Tags are components of HTML documents
  that specify the behavore of the text. Elements can be either <b>Inline</b> elements that directly effect that line, or <b>Block</b> elements that effect a block of code that with 
  which the size of the block can be changed to fit your needs.
  </p>
  <b>Computers be stupid.
  <p><em>Computers can only interpret the code that it sees amd as such cannot think for the programmer and close tags that they forgot to close...</em></b> Sorry.</p>
